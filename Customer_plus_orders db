#In order to quantify statistics about customer and order data, I'm using SQL to query a database that has numerous tables. 

#1. In January, how many orders were placed?
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

#2. What percentage of orders were for iPhones?
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. For every order placed in February, choose the client account numbers. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. What was the price of the cheapest product that was sold in January?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1; 

#5. How much money was made overall in January from each product sold?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
 FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

SELECT orderid, quantity, price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales; 

SELECT SUM(quantity), price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price;

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product; 

#6. What products did 548 Lincoln St., Seattle, WA 98101 sell in February? How many of each did they sell? What was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. What percentage of customers placed orders for more than two items at once, and how much did those customers typically spend?
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum)
, avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';
